# ML-Based-SDN-DDoS-Detection
Overview

This research proposes a machine learning-based intrusion detection framework for detecting SYN-Flood Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDN). The system operates on flow-level features and integrates real-time deployment within an SDN controller.
